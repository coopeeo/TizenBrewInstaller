## Installation

To install TizenBrew Installer, you'll need a PC or a mobile device and a USB Stick.

First, download the [latest userwidget.zip file](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrewInstaller/releases/latest) from releases. After downloading it, extract the zip file directly to your USB Stick in a folder called `userwidget` and plug it in to your TV.

After plugging the USB Stick in, the TV should show a notification saying the app is being installed. 

After it's installed, you'll need to set Developer Mode Host PC IP to `127.0.0.1`.

You can follow [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK) guide for more information.

Note: If your TVs language is RTL (right to left), the IP must be `1.0.0.127`.

After setting the Developer Mode settings, you should be able to use TizenBrew Installer.
